## 🤖 Automation Testing - The Code Samurai 🏯⚔️
"If something can be automated, it shall be automated!"
This section contains scripts and frameworks for automating repetitive testing tasks. Whether it's Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright, I wield automation like a samurai wields a katana!

✅ Selenium WebDriver for UI automation <br>
✅ Playwright for modern web testing <br>

## ✍️ Manual Testing - The Eyes of the QA Hunter 🔍🧐
"Nothing escapes the trained eyes of a QA tester!"
Here, I explore software like a detective in a mystery anime 🕵️, uncovering bugs, defects, and unexpected behaviors. This folder contains test cases, bug reports, and exploratory testing logs.

✅ Well-structured test cases & test plans 📋 <br>
✅ Bug reports documenting software issues 🐛 <br>
✅ Exploratory and functional testing techniques 🛠️ <br>
---
## 🌐 API Testing - The Gateway Guardian 🚪🛡️
"APIs are like secret scrolls—powerful, yet mysterious!"
APIs form the backbone of applications, and this section is dedicated to testing endpoints, responses, and integrations using tools like Postman, REST Assured, and SoapUI.

## 🚀 Performance Testing - The Power Level Scanner 🔥💪
"Can this system handle over 9000 users?!" 👀💥
Every software has its limits—and my goal is to find them! Using JMeter, LoadRunner, and other tools, I push systems to their max to uncover bottlenecks.

✅ Load & stress testing with JMeter <br>
✅ Performance analysis & reports 📊 <br>
✅ Scalability testing for high-traffic applications <br>

## 🔐 Security Testing - The Cyber Shinobi 🥷🔓
"A system is only as strong as its weakest vulnerability!"
In this section, I don the cloak of a white-hat hacker 🏴‍☠️ to find and eliminate security threats using OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and penetration testing techniques.

✅ Web security testing <br> 
✅ Vulnerability assessments with OWASP ZAP <br>
---
## 🔄 CI/CD - The DevOps Summoning Jutsu 📜⚡
"Automation is the key to a seamless deployment!"
Here, I integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring continuous quality checks in DevOps environments using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI/CD.
